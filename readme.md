# Pranktool

## Introduction

The Pranktool is a device to simulate keystrokes on a computer (or any device that can handle a USB keyboard).
It pluggs into a USB port and pretends to be a keyboard, just that it can type much faster than a human.
its suitable for pentesting, for example, or to play a prank on your friends (as the name might suggest).
